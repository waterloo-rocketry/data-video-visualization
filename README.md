# data-video-visualization
Code for taking csv data and dumping into a mp4 file to be used in videos (poster session, static fire videos, and so on). 

Example of code from SF6 is included, along with a working directory for any other files that may be utilized by future users. 
Performance isn't great and not at all optimized. It takes a few minutes to render the example video, and no attempts have been made to add some sort of 'waiting' feature in the command line.

Note: this repository requires a hard-path to a ffmpeg executable in its current form
